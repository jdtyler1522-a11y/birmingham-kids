Build me a bright, playful, mobile-first childcare directory website for the Birmingham, Alabama metro area.
Tech stack: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). Ship as a single-folder project with:

index.html (UI + content)

styles.css (theme + layout)

app.js (data loading, filtering, search, sort)

data/centers.json (editable dataset)

assets/ (logo placeholder + icons)

README.md (how to update data)

Purpose

Parents and soon-to-be parents should be able to quickly find vetted childcare options around Birmingham (city + suburbs). The directory should be easy to browse, filter, and compare.

Design Direction

Vibe: bright, friendly, playful—think modern kids’ library, not cartoonish.

Color palette:

Primary: #FFB703 (sunny yellow)

Accent 1: #8ECAE6 (sky blue)

Accent 2: #219EBC (deep teal)

Accent 3: #FB8500 (orange)

Neutral: #F7F7F7 / text #1F2937

Typography: rounded sans for headings (e.g., “Poppins” or “Quicksand”), humanist sans for body (e.g., “Inter”). Include Google Fonts links.

Components: pill filters, friendly badges (e.g., “Infant Care,” “Openings”), soft card shadows, rounded corners (16–20px), playful iconography (simple SVGs).

Accessibility: sufficient contrast, focus states, semantic HTML, ARIA for filter controls.

Pages/Sections

Single-page app with anchored sections:

Hero

Logo, headline: “Birmingham Childcare Directory”

Subhead: “Find quality childcare across the Birmingham metro—compare programs, locations, costs, and openings.”

Prominent search bar (keyword) + quick filters (age range, location).

Filters Bar (sticky on scroll)

Responsive cards (3-col desktop, 2-col tablet, 1-col mobile) with:

Map (optional toggle)

Simple Leaflet map showing pins for current filtered results. No external APIs required; use Leaflet with local tiles or embed links only. If including Leaflet, keep it lightweight.

Submit a Center

Static form UI (Name, Address, City, Phone, Email, Website, Programs, Ages, Tuition range, Hours, Accreditation, Notes). For now, clicking “Submit” opens mailto with prefilled body to hello@example.com. Put placeholder and instructions to switch to form backend later.

Note: “Not a comprehensive list. Verify licensing and availability directly with providers.”

Links: “Update Listing,” “Submit a Center,” “About,” “Contact.”

Create data/centers.json and load it in app.js. Example schema:

Functionality Requirements

Client-side filtering & sorting: Combine multiple filters at once. Update result count live. Persist filter state in the URL hash so users can share filtered views.

Search: Fuzzy keyword search across name, neighborhood, city, programs.

Map toggle (optional): If included, sync map pins with filters; clicking a pin highlights the card.

Details modal: Load full record; accessible close; Esc key support.

Badges: Show key attributes (e.g., “NAEYC,” “First Class Pre-K,” “Openings Now,” “Accepts Subsidy”).

Hours logic: Allow filtering for earliest open time and latest close time.

Sorting: Name, Tuition (low→high), Early Open, Late Close. If geolocation permission granted, also “Nearest to me.”

No results state: Friendly message with “Clear filters” button.

Performance: Lazy-load images; keep bundle small.

SEO & Metadata

Semantic HTML, descriptive titles and meta descriptions.

Open Graph/Twitter cards ready.

Add schema.org JSON-LD for ChildCare/LocalBusiness on each card rendered (name, address, phone, openingHours, sameAs/website, geo if present).

Accessibility

Keyboard navigable filters and modals, visible focus outlines.

ARIA labels for controls, alt text for images.

Color contrast meets WCAG AA.
